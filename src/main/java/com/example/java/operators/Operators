Operators in Java are special symbols that perform operations on variables and values. They are used to manipulate data in various ways, such as performing arithmetic calculations, comparing values, and assigning values. Java supports a wide range of operators, which can be categorized into several groups:

Arithmetic Operators:
+ (Addition): Adds two numbers.
- (Subtraction): Subtracts the right operand from the left operand.
* (Multiplication): Multiplies two numbers.
/ (Division): Divides the left operand by the right operand.
% (Modulus): Returns the remainder of the division.

Example code>>>>>>>>
int a = 10;
int b = 5;
int sum = a + b; // sum will be 15
int difference = a - b; // difference will be 5
int product = a * b; // product will be 50
int quotient = a / b; // quotient will be 2
int remainder = a % b; // remainder will be 0


Relational Operators:
== (Equal to): Checks if two values are equal.
!= (Not equal to): Checks if two values are not equal.
< (Less than): Checks if the left operand is less than the right operand.
> (Greater than): Checks if the left operand is greater than the right operand.
<= (Less than or equal to): Checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.
>= (Greater than or equal to): Checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.
Example code>>>>>>>>
int x = 5;
int y = 10;
boolean isEqual = (x == y); // isEqual will be false
boolean isNotEqual = (x != y); // isNotEqual will be true
boolean isLess = (x < y); // isLess will be true
boolean isGreater = (x > y); // isGreater will be false


Logical Operators:
&& (Logical AND): Returns true if both conditions are true.
|| (Logical OR): Returns true if at least one condition is true.
! (Logical NOT): Reverses the value of a boolean expression.

Example code>>>>>>>>
boolean a = true;
boolean b = false;
boolean result1 = a && b; // result1 will be false
boolean result2 = a || b; // result2 will be true
boolean result3 = !a; // result3 will be false

Assignment Operators:
= (Assignment): Assigns the value of the right operand to the left operand.
+=, -= , *= , /=, %= (Compound Assignment): Performs the specified operation and assigns the result to the left operand.

Example code>>>>>>>>
int num = 10;
num += 5; // num is now 15 (equivalent to num = num + 5)
num -= 3; // num is now 12 (equivalent to num = num - 3)
These are some of the basic operators in Java, but there are more, including bitwise operators, conditional (ternary) operator, and instanceof operator, among others. Each operator serves a specific purpose and can be used in various situations to manipulate data and control program flow.
